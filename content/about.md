My name's Alex, a Computer Science student at ETH ZÃ¼rich. The content you can expect from this little project of mine is: more little contents of mine :). These range from real life applications (a gardening arduino) to more abstract projects. Enjoy your stay and if you have any comments, contact me here: aschlieper@gmail.com
