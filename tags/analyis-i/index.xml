Now this topic wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned in our script but I rather stumbled upon it on youtube.
The premise is the following:
We assume that we have a function f(x) which we can integrate over the interval a to b.
Calculate the following integral: $$\int_{2}^{4}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{6-x} + \sqrt{x}} dx$$ Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look trivial now, does it?</description></item><item><title>Exam period</title><link>https://www.schlieper.ch/posts/2021/05/exam-period/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 15:37:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.schlieper.ch/posts/2021/05/exam-period/</guid><description>Since I am a student at ETH I will be entering my so called &amp;ldquo;holidays&amp;rdquo; in a week. They are &amp;ldquo;holidays&amp;rdquo; since they serve as 2 months of preparation for a series of exams. During this time I will be posting the one or the other concept, algorithm or thought experiment that fall into one of four subject:
Algorithms and Probabilities Algorithms and Probabilities, or AnW for short, is all about probabilistic algorithms.</description></item></channel></rss>
