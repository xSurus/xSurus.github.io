The idea was to provide a platform for businesses to offer discounts and promotions to groups (henceforth referred to as seekers) and to thus simplify the purchasing of such amenities. The hackathon was a great success, with a diverse group of students coming together to work on the project. We were amazed at the creativity and dedication of the participants, and were proud to see the finished product take shape over the course of the weekend.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>The voucher marketplace that was developed is a web-based platform that allows suppliers to create and post vouchers for seekers to purchase. Seekers can browse the available vouchers and purchase them. The vouchers can then be redeemed at the participating businesses, providing a convenient and cost-effective way for seekers to find vouchers for their events (such as this hackathon).</p>
<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>
<p>For the frontend, we used the Next.js framework to build a responsive and user-friendly interface for the voucher marketplace. Next.js is a popular framework for building server-rendered React applications, and we found it to be a great choice for this project due to its ease of use and powerful features. On the backend, we used a Postgres database to store and manage the data for the voucher marketplace. Postgres is a widely used and reliable open-source database, and we found it to be a great fit for our needs. We used the Node.js runtime to connect to the Postgres database and perform various operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting vouchers.</p>
<p>Throughout the project I took on the responsibility as project lead, and I was very happy with the results. This was one of the first times that I officially took on this role and I definitely faced new challenges. As project lead it was my responsibility to make the   to coordinate between the two members working on the backend with the other two members working on the frontend. I also had to make sure that the project was on track and that we were able to meet the deadline. To do that I had to identify and follow through on the crucial parts of the project and cut out aspcts that were not necessary. One of the compromises we had to undergo was the decision for the design of the payement system, which takes on a very tedious and time-consuming process.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p>voucherio has a number of features that make it a great tool for both suppliers and seekers. Some of the most notable features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A user-friendly interface that allows suppliers to easily create and manage their vouchers</li>
<li>A search function that allows seekers to find vouchers that match their needs</li>
<li>A filter function that allows seekers to filter vouchers by category

One of the standout features of the voucher marketplace is the ability for businesses to customize their vouchers to suit their specific needs. This includes setting expiration dates, limits on the number of vouchers that can be purchased, and other parameters to ensure that the vouchers are used effectively.

</ul>
<h2 id="improvements">Improvements</h2>
<p>We are proud of the work that we have done on voucherio, and believe that it is a great example of what can be achieved in a short amount of time. However, there are still many improvements that can be made to the project, and we hope to continue working on it in the future. Some of the improvements that we would like to make include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving the current payment system to allow seekers to purchase vouchers more easily</li>
<li>Adding a statistics page to allow suppliers to view the performance of their vouchers</li>
<li>Reworking the UI and theme the whole page</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>We are very happy with the results of the hackathon, and believe that we have created a great product that will be useful to many people. As with any other hackathon project, there are still many improvements that can be made, and we hope to continue working on the project in the future. It was a challenge, but, as always, a very welcome one.</p>
<p>We now began working with CAT, our student associations computer application team. The goal being to translate this project into production code that can be used by our student association. To do this we are in the process of reworking some of our backend code to make it more efficient and scalable. We are also working on the frontend to make it more user-friendly and to add some new features. We are very excited to see the finished product and hope that it will be a great success.</p>

After hearing from our student association, vis, that they were hosting a Hackathon at their VIScon, we signed up immediately. This was all of our first time participating in any kind of such competition and much like with this post, we didn&rsquo;t really know what we were doing. I gathered four of my friends, some of whom were better programmers, and we dove in head-first.</p>
<h1 id="challenges-and-organization">Challenges and organization</h1>
<p>This hack was hosted at our university in the libraries and lecture halls. It started on a Friday afternoon, and we were soon introduced to the framework of this hackathon. Our task was to facilitate the life of our students through services that could be implemented by the student association.</p>
<p>I do not quite recall all the challenges that one could choose from, but this should present a rough overview:
One challenge consisted of creating a web app which, using a pretrained model, one could input the recording of a lecture, and it would present you with a summary of the contents of the lecture, cut down to a rough length determined by the user.</p>
<p>Another challenge prompted you to remake the vis poster collection and to implement new features such as a search feature.
Yet another challenge was to create an infrastructure finder application for our campus. The university does provide maps, but they are hard to read at times, do not include all the facilities and don&rsquo;t really show you the way to the desired destination. This ended up being the challenge that we chose.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h1>
<p>The beginning was optimistic, as all hacks are. High spirits, free mate, beer and food were some of the highlights. We quickly got started brainstorming for the structure of our website. Once we got settled on the structure and the design, we discussed how we would implement this. We decided that we were going to use next.js, which gives us a wide range of useful features, for our application in the frontend and mongoDB as our backend solution.</p>
<p>As a team of 5 we had a good amount of manpower, we only needed to correctly split up the tasks to ensure efficient completion of the tasks. We decided to split up the tasks as follows: 2 of my friends and I would be responsible for the frontend implementation, and the other two (who were significantly more experienced than either 3 of us) would be responsible for the backend and troubleshooting the inevitable problems that would arise. I furthermore took on the responsibility as team lead and kept an overview of who was doing what and where we stood with each part of our application. We were all very excited to get started, and we dove right in.

</figure>

I got started on creating a landing page. Drafting up a first version didn&rsquo;t take too long, little did I know, though, that this was far from the final product.</p>
<p>During the hack, we had a few mentors who were there to help us with any problems that we might have. They were very helpful, and we were able to get a lot of help from them. Among others, there was a UI/UX expert from beekeeper. He managed to give me a lot of insight on what goes into the design of a website and how to make it more appealing to the user. He also gave me some tips on how to make the website more responsive and how to make it look better on mobile devices. I was very grateful for his help and I learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>In the end, the landing page was remade/tweaked about a dozen times.</p>
<h1 id="our-application">Our application</h1>
<p>The actual application to find amenities on campus took more time. The first challenge was to get the location of the amenities. Unfortunately, the university does not provide a public API for this, so we had to scrape the data from the university website. This was a bit of a challenge as the website was not very well-structured and the data was not easily accessible. We managed to get the data though, and we were able to get the location of the amenities.</p>
<p>The orientation inside the building was the next challenge. It is VERY challenging to locate the user in a 3 dimensional space. We thought of a few different approaches, but none of them were feasible to implement. We ended up letting the user select his location himself, inputting the building, floor and closest room number.</p>
<p>The last piece of the puzzle was to find the way from our current location to the closest (functional) selected amenity. Our suggest approach was to implement a coordinate grid on top of the maps and use a pathfinding algorithm (such as A*). We quickly had to scrap the idea of actually coding this up, since that would have been  outside the scope of this hackathon.
For the demonstration, we decided to hard-code some locations and the corresponding paths. This was not ideal, but it was the best we could do in the time we had.</p>
<h1 id="the-result">The result</h1>
<p>After 36 grueling hours (and a collective amount of 7 hours of sleep over two nights) we got to presenting our finalized product. We were very proud of what we had managed to build in this timeframe.</p>
<p>When it came to the judging, we were not expecting much. We were however one of the few teams that had a working demo.
We ended up getting 2nd place in the hackathon, which was a huge delight for us. Not only that, but we also managed to snag a few wins, including best commit message, the best Lego creation and best readme.

<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>These 36 hours were an incredible experience for me. I managed to learn a lot about web development and got to meet a lot of new people. I am very grateful for the opportunity to participate in this hackathon, and I am looking forward to the next one.</p>
<p>It showed me that for an application to work, a lot of coding, designing, rewriting and scrapping is required.</p>

Now this topic wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned in our script but I rather stumbled upon it on youtube.
The premise is the following:
We assume that we have a function f(x) which we can integrate over the interval a to b.
Calculate the following integral: $$\int_{2}^{4}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{6-x} + \sqrt{x}} dx$$ Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look trivial now, does it?</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the first post of this series centered around my university degree I will be talking about integration. Now this topic wasn&rsquo;t mentioned in our script but I rather stumbled upon it on youtube.</p>
<p>The premise is the following:</p>
<p>We assume that we have a function f(x) which we can integrate over the interval a to b.</p>
<p>Calculate the following integral:
$$\int_{2}^{4}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{6-x} + \sqrt{x}} dx$$
Doesn&rsquo;t look trivial now, does it?
But miraculously, it is! This whole integral equates to:
$$\frac{b-a}{2} = 1$$.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at another integral for fun.
$$\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\frac{\sqrt{sin x}}{\sqrt{sin x} + \sqrt{cos x}}dx$$</p>
<p>Can you see an emerging pattern? This is yet again equal to:
$$\frac{b-a}{2} = \frac{\frac{\pi}{2}}{2} = \frac{\pi}{4}$$.</p>
<p>We can observe that for any integral of the form
$$\int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(x)}{f(a+b-x) + f(x)}dx$$
the following holds:
$$\int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(x)}{f(a+b-x) + f(x)}dx = \frac{b-a}{2}$$.</p>
<p>Now if I were to just throw this out there I would probably get lynched by Ueli Maurer himself. Thus the proof goes as following:
We know that:
$$\int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(x)}{f(a+b-x) + f(x)}dx = I$$
This will be our first equation.
Now we set \(u = a + b - x\) and \(\frac{du}{dx} = - 1 \implies du = -dx\) by putting that into our integral we receive:
$$\int_{b}^{a}\frac{f(a+b-u)}{f(u) + f(a+b-u)} (-du) = I\newline
\implies \int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(a+b-u)}{f(u) + f(a+b-u)} du = I \newline
\implies \int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(a+b-x)}{f(x) + f(a+b-x)} dx = I
$$
Since u is only used as a placeholder variable we may rename it as x.
By adding these two integrals (which both equal I) together, we are left with:
$$
\int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(a+b-x) + f(x)}{f(x) + f(a+b-x)} dx = 2I\newline
\implies \int_{a}^{b} dx = 2I \newline
\implies b-a = 2I \newline
\implies I = \frac{b-a}{2} \square $$</p>
<p>Now you can solve some integrals very quickly and without the need of much calculation!</p>
<p>This post was largely inspired and based on this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfZObnTIsYk">&ldquo;MindYourDecisions&rdquo;</a> video. Check it out for another example for an integral which you can solve with this method.</p>

<h2 id="algorithms-and-probabilities">Algorithms and Probabilities</h2>
<p>Algorithms and Probabilities, or AnW for short, is all about probabilistic algorithms. This ranged from colouring to matchings over to probabilities (expected value, variance) to flows and convex hulls.</p>
<h2 id="analyis-1">Analyis 1</h2>
<p>Analysis I is your basic Calculus course. From supremum and infimum up to partial integration this represents the main, purely mathematical part of this semester&rsquo;s courses.</p>
<h2 id="digital-design-and-computer-architecture">Digital design and computer architecture</h2>
<p>Digital design and computer architecture, or DDCA for short, deals with the essence of computers at a lower abstraction level. This ranges from simple logic gates all the way to branch prediction and memory optimization.</p>
<h2 id="parallel-programming">Parallel Programming</h2>
<p>Parallel Programming, or Pprog for short, discusses, as the name suggests, the idea of parallel programming. Starting off with manually starting threads over using ForkJoin pools to transactional memory and STM. We looked at the benefits, but mainly the flaws of each of the implemented methods.</p>
<p>During this period of &ldquo;relaxation&rdquo; I will only be posting in this format. Hopefully there will be a few interesting topics for you too :)</p>
