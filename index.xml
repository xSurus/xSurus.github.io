Now this topic wasn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned in our script but I rather stumbled upon it on youtube.
The premise is the following:
Assuming you have a function f(x) which you can integrate over the interval a to b. Calculate the following integral: $$\int_{a}^{b}\frac{\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{6-x} + \sqrt{x}}dx$$ Doesn&amp;rsquo;t look trivial now, does it? But miraculously, it is!</description></item><item><title>Exam period</title><link>https://www.schlieper.ch/posts/2021/05/exam-period/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 May 2021 15:37:47 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.schlieper.ch/posts/2021/05/exam-period/</guid><description>Since I am a student at ETH I will be entering my so called &amp;ldquo;holidays&amp;rdquo; in a week. They are &amp;ldquo;holidays&amp;rdquo; since they serve as 2 months of preparation for a series of exams. During this time I will be posting the one or the other concept, algorithm or thought experiment that fall into one of four subject:
Algorithms and Probabilities Algorithms and Probabilities, or AnW for short, is all about probabilistic algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Welcome</title><link>https://www.schlieper.ch/posts/2021/04/welcome/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 19:50:31 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://www.schlieper.ch/posts/2021/04/welcome/</guid><description>Welcome to my blog. This is my first ever post and I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over what you can expect on here and how to navigate the site.
Introduction This will be a personal work where I outline interesting projects, small guides and other little quirks. The content will be mainly based around CS-related subjects as well as some interesting mathematical concepts.
Navigating this blog As any other blog this one has three components: The home page, where you will get a rough overview of the blog, the about page, where you get to find out more about this blog as well as about me and last but not least the Posts page where all of my posts will be listed.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://www.schlieper.ch/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.schlieper.ch/about/</guid><description>Welcome to my small blog. I will be posting interesting side projects of mine on here. About me I am a CS student currently in his second semester. More to come :)
