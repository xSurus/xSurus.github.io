This is my first ever post and I&amp;rsquo;ll be going over what you can expect on here and how to navigate the site.
Introduction This will be a personal work where I outline interesting projects, small guides and other little quirks. The content will be mainly based around CS-related subjects as well as some interesting mathematical concepts.
Navigating this blog As any other blog this one has three components: The home page, where you will get a rough overview of the blog, the about page, where you get to find out more about this blog as well as about me and last but not least the Posts page where all of my posts will be listed.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://www.schlieper.ch/about/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.schlieper.ch/about/</guid><description>Welcome to my small blog.
